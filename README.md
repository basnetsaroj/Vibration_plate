# Free Vibration Analysis of a Simplified Compressor Blade
### Modeled as a Rectangular Plate with NACA 2412 Thickness Distribution

This project implements the Reissner–Mindlin plate theory using the Rayleigh–Ritz method 
to perform free vibration analysis of a simplified compressor blade. The blade is modeled 
as a rectangular plate with a variable thickness following the NACA 2412 airfoil profile.

**Key Features**
- Variable thickness using NACA 2412 formula
- Rayleigh–Ritz implementation in Python
- Reissner–Mindlin first-order shear deformation theory
- Gaussian quadrature integration
- Mode shape and frequency validation against ANSYS FEM results

**Main Results**
- <3% difference for first six natural frequencies compared to ANSYS
- Bending-dominated and membrane-type modes identified via energy partitioning
